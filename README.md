# DSL Test Utility

Tool to automate account information retrieval and DSL modem testing. Written in AutoHotkey(AHK)

This repository exists to give an example of my approach to problem solving using software.  
This script has been scrubbed to remove the actual URLs and tool names used at the company that I worked for.

This is my first crack at any kind of programming past 'hello world' - I realize the code is probably a mess.
I just first needed it to work. 

The DSL support contract that I was on ended before I could get my team to use this software, but it served me well in the few weeks I was able to use it. 

I left some code sections in that are commented out because I left the contract so quickly that I couldn't 
remember why they were commented out.
